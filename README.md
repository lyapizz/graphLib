# graphLib
Library for undirected and directed graphs of custom type to find a way between vertices.

Library contains of three operations:
1) addVertex(Graph<V> graph, V vertex)
Add vertex to graph
2) addEdge(Graph<V> graph, V start, V end)
Add edge between vertex start and vertex end
3) getPath(Graph<V> graph, V start, V end)
Returns a list of edges between vertices start and end.
